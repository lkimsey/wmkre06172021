== Description ==

Much more than an IDX plugin for WordPress, Optima Express includes an iHomefinder account with an [agent](https://www.ihomefinder.com/solutions/real-estate-agent-marketing/) or [brokerage team](https://www.ihomefinder.com/solutions/real-estate-brokerage-marketing/) solution to grow your business.

SAVE TIME. WORK SMARTER. GROW FASTER.

To grow your real estate business, you need more than just a website with property search and lead capture. You need a marketing machine. 

Make the most of every opportunity with a consistent, repeatable process that applies your recipe for success. Automated campaigns engage your leads with content that moves them closer to closing while you focus your time on doing what you do best. 

* Attract and convert new leads with the best IDX property search available. 
* Convert site traffic to leads with configurable registration, multiple lead forms, and market report and alert signups.
* Automate new lead follow-ups and engage every lead with email campaigns that you control. Every lead automatically enters your account and email campaigns. 
* Aggregate leads. Your iHomefinder account will automatically import new leads from over 30 popular lead sources and enter them in email campaigns. 
* Smart Content positions you as a market expert and moves your leads closer to closing with personalized listing recommendations and market reports based on the source of your leads and their search and viewing activity.
* A mobile app, included with agent plans, helps you manage and contact leads, monitor lead activity, and understand your leads’ interests to inform your conversations.
* Manage and track activities and tasks and stay on target with your goals with a real estate CRM. 


HOW IT WORKS

Optima Express Plugin

The Optima Express plugin works together with your iHomefinder account. The plugin provides the WordPress tools you need to add and control iHomefinder IDX features on your WordPress website. 

iHomefinder Account

Your iHomefinder account provides access to the IDX data provided by your MLS. It also provides your IDX Control Panel which is the “command center” for managing your account settings and preferences, customizing property search options, managing leads, and much more. CRM and marketing automation features are also accessed in your IDX Control Panel if you have our CRM option.

Optima Leads – Mobile App

Our app for agents syncs with your iHomefinder account to provide instant access to your leads and their property search activity. You can also add new leads on your mobile device which can place them automatically into email nurture campaigns that you choose.


FEATURE HIGHLIGHTS

* Real Estate CRM for Agents
Most agents struggle to grow because they’re juggling too many systems and they lose track of leads and their status and interests. They also lack the proper tools to manage their business and track their progress against their goals. Our real estate CRM built for agents solves these problems, saving you valuable time and helping you grow your book of business faster. [Learn more >](https://www.ihomefinder.com/features/real-estate-crm/). Leads from all your sources receive automated, consistent follow-up, so nobody slips through the cracks! Jump-start lead engagement from the moment they become a new lead with personalized, dynamic follow-up you won't get anywhere else. New leads from Zillow, Trulia, Realtor.com, and other lead generation services are automatically imported into your iHomefinder account. "Smart Content" sends automated listing recommendations and market data based on your leads' search and viewing behavior. Tailor messages by mixing your own custom content with Smart Content.

* IDX Property Search & Lead Capture
Built on decades of property search design experience, Eureka Search provides a search experience buyers and sellers are familiar with and keeps them coming back to your website. Users can search locations by name or they can draw on a map to define a custom search location. You can also create any number of saved searches ("Markets") for displaying throughout your site in a variety of gallery options. [Learn more >](https://www.ihomefinder.com/features/idx-search/)

* MarketBoost – Automated Web & Email Reports
Position yourself as the local market expert and engage your leads while moving them closer to closing. MarketBoost automates website and email reports for daily active & sold listings, weekly open homes, and monthly market stats. Just choose a location or draw on a map and select any additional criteria to create a new Market. Report pages can be embedded in your own pages or posts or you can link directly to the report pages created directly on your domain for each Market. Add email report subscribers individually or in bulk and capture new leads through the email report subscription option provided in each report page on your website. Add your past clients to monthly stats reports for their neighborhood to stay top-of-mind while keeping them up-to-date on market activity in their neighborhood. Link to your Market reports from your blog or embed market reports in your blog posts. Share Market links in your social media channels to grow your following. [Learn more >](https://www.ihomefinder.com/features/real-estate-market-statistics/)

* Integrations
Without the right integrations for lead management, agents often go out of their way to manually re-enter leads or use spreadsheets to get leads into the different systems they use. This uses up valuable time and leaves room for error.
New leads you receive in your iHomefinder account can automatically forward to other online services, and new leads from other services can automatically enter your iHomefinder account. Once new leads arrive in your iHomefinder account, they’ll receive immediate, personalized follow-up with email nurturing campaigns that move them closer to closing.

* Real Estate Agent App
Work your leads wherever you are with our real estate agent app, Optima Leads. Included with all agent accounts, Optima Leads keeps you connected to your IDX account on your mobile device, providing instant access to your important lead information without a login. Monitor your leads' activity on your website to learn what's catching their interest and inform your next conversation with them. Did you meet a new lead at business or social event? Add them to your lead database right on your phone to automatically enter them in a new lead email campaign. Instead of handing them a business card, you'll engage them with relevant market content, positioning you as a local expert and bringing them back to your site over and over again. The app also makes it easy to capture attendees at open house event so they're in your CRM where you can later assign them to an email campaign with market stats and listings for the neighborhood. Using the app, you'll quickly learn who is engaged with your emails so you can follow-up with them. [Learn more >](https://www.ihomefinder.com/features/real-estate-agent-app/)

= Can I talk with someone or get a demo? =
Our account excutives are available to answer your questions and provide a demo a number of different ways. You can chat with them on [our website](https://www.ihomefinder.com) during business hours, contact them [by email](https://www.ihomefinder.com/resources/contact-us/), or schedule a [15-minute demo](https://www.ihomefinder.com/ihomefinder-tour/).

= Can anyone get an iHomefinder account? =
Only real estate professionals who are active members of a [supported MLS](https://www.ihomefinder.com/resources/idx-coverage) can sign-up for a paid account with live MLS listings. If you don't see your MLS listed, please [contact us](https://www.ihomefinder.com/resources/contact-us/) about adding IDX service for your MLS.

= Are recently sold listings available in property search? =
Yes, in most locations we provide both active listings and recently sold listings from the MLS data, displayed separately in the search results.

= I receive new leads from different online advertising and marketing services. Can I get them into my iHomefinder account? =
Our Premium + CRM plan will automatically import new leads from over [30 different online services](https://www.ihomefinder.com/features/integrations/), including Trulia and Zillow. And you can assign new leads to different [follow-up email campaigns](https://www.ihomefinder.com/features/real-estate-email-marketing/) that you choose, based on their source. This ensures every new lead, no matter where they came from, receives an immediate follow-up with your customized message and content. And they are nurtured after the initial follow-up with email campaigns you choose. You can use the email campaigns we provide for buyers and sellers or build your own with our user-friendly editor. 

= Do I have to contact my MLS when signing up for an account? =
Our automated system will send you any necessary IDX approval paperwork when you sign up for a paid iHomefinder account. When completed and returned to us, we will manage your IDX paperwork through the approval process required by your MLS.

= How long does it take to get MLS approval? =
Depending upon your MLS, approval can take anywhere from less than a business day to a week. While you're waiting for MLS approval you can test the Optima Express IDX plugin on your site with the provided demo IDX listing data.

= Where can I find out if my MLS is supported? =
Please refer to our current list of [supported MLSs](https://www.ihomefinder.com/resources/idx-coverage).

= Does the plugin provide access to multiple MLSs? =
The plugin will provide IDX data for the MLSs you request when you sign up for your paid iHomefinder account. If you belong to more than one MLS, you can request service for additional MLSs at an additional cost.

= Will my site get SEO credit for IDX listings? =
Yes. The Optima Express + MarketBoost IDX plugin **doesn't "frame" property listing data** into your WordPress site. Instead, property listings appear directly under your domain, ensuring that your site gets full SEO credit. In any page or blog post, you can easily embed IDX map searches, Markets (unlimited galleries of listings that search engines will index, matching listing location and criteria you choose), Market Reports, and lead capture forms. This gives you full control over all SEO aspects of a page containing the IDX content you choose.

= Will Optima Express + MarketBoost work with a mobile device? =
When paired with a responsive WordPress theme, Optima Express + MarketBoost is optimized for viewing on any mobile device.

= What kind of lead capture tools are provided? =
Property detail pages include lead capture options such as Schedule a Showing, Request Info, and Save Property) and registration prompts can be presented through the property search experience with different trigger and strength settings (optional, forced, etc.). Leads can also register to receive daily email alerts for listings that match their chosen search criteria. You can add a registration form pop-up on any custom page of your website. This is perfect for acquiring new leads by offering “gated” content on your site.

= Can I customize the locations that are available for searching on my website? =
You can control the geographic areas (neighborhoods, subdivisions, etc.) that appear in the auto-suggest list when users start typing in the Location field within the Eureka map search. You can also set up a Custom City List in your IDX Control Panel to control which cities appear when they click in the Location field.

= How frequently is the listing data updated? =
Our IDX property listing data is updated every two hours for most MLSs, and as frequently as every 15 minutes for some MLSs.

= Where can I learn more about the features and pricing? =
Please visit our [Agent Solutions](https://www.ihomefinder.com/solutions/real-estate-agent-marketing/) or [Brokerage Solutions](https://www.ihomefinder.com/solutions/real-estate-brokerage-marketing/) page on the iHomefinder website to learn more about features and pricing. 

= Some parts of the IDX display look a little distorted. How can this be fixed? =
There's most likely a Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) conflict between styles defined by your theme and styles defined by the plugin. You can use a tool like Firebug to identify the problematic styles. Then, go to the Optima Express > Configuration section of the plugin and enter overrides for the problematic styles. Or, [contact our support team](https://www.ihomefinder.com/resources/support/#contact) for assistance.

= Which WordPress themes do you recommend using with Optima Express? =
You'll find specific themes we can recommend using with Optima Express in the [WordPress Theme Guide](https://www.ihomefinder.com/resources/support/wordpress-theme-guide/) on the iHomefinder website. Optima Express will work with many other themes but we recommend testing them early with Optima Express before making a decision since themes and plugins can sometimes have conflicts.
